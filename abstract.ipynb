      "in subsequent years market participants in energy markets face new forms of\n",

      "sures. The thesis focuses on three aspects of uncertainty in energy markets. The\n",
      "ﬁrst one is quantity risk in electricity markets, which arises due to uncertainty\n",
      "about future demand and is intensiﬁed by the limited storability of electricity.\n",
      "The second one is electricity price risk, which is especially relevant in view of\n",

      "tic demand. The third one is the risk of spillover eﬀects between uncertainty\n",
      "in energy markets and uncertainty in related markets, especially agricultural\n",
      "commodity markets.\n",
      "The thesis is structured in three discrete chapters, in\n",
      "which we investigate these three aspects. The proposed methodologies are ap-\n",
